Release Notes for the first Beta of Version 1.0

See the last section for list of changes and improvements since last version.

===[ WARNING ]===

This software is being released in a "beta" state.  This means that 
the software MAY be unstable or unpredictable.  Please use this version
for testing and tinkering ONLY.

Our use and testing shows that the software is stable enough to be useful, doesn't corrupt or lose data, and performs pretty much as promised.  But there are still numerous small problems and bugs that need to be fixed before we can give a more general stamp of approval.

Until then, this software is FOR TESTING ONLY.

===[ Changes and Improvements ]===

This update includes too many fixes, tweaks, corrections and refinements to list, but here's a few of the highlights:

  * It's much easier for new users to get started.  They are stepped through a couple of introductory questions and settings before the program creates their first crop plan for them.

  * For crops and varieties which can be both direct seeded (DS) and transplanted (TP), you can now enter different information for either case.

  * Plantings (individual entries in a crop plan) are now explicitly marked as being either DS or TP.  If the crop or variety has different information for DS vs TP (see previous point), the appropriate info is displayed and used in calculations.
  
  * There is a completely new, much easier to understand mechanism for creating, selecting and deleting crop plans.  Additionally, crop plans can now have years and descriptions attached to them, making it very easy to manage different crop plans which you might create.
  
  * Plantings now have "actual" dates, as well as "planned" dates.  Recording the actual date on which you planted, transplanted or picked something is better for record keeping and it allows the program to better represent the reality of what's happening on the farm and in the greenhouse.
 
  * Plantings can now be marked as having been planted, transplanted or picked ... "completed", in other words.  These work even if you don't use the "actual" date mechanism mentioned above.
  
  * Plantings can be marked as "ignored" or skipped.  They're not deleted, but they won't show up in most of the lists or in the print outs.  This is useful for when a planting is just too late to be worth it, or maybe something just doesn't make sense anymore.

  * The program is better at remembering what you were doing the last time you used the program; what plan you were working on, which columns you were viewing, which -- if any -- of the predefined filters you had in place, to name a few.

  * Crops, Varieties and Plantings now track more data fields.
 
  * Added preliminary support for importing CSV data for crop plans and the CropDB,  (Thanks to volunteer contributor: sm_zl_kimi)
 
  * We've added a number of settings to let you better customize the program.

  * Crop plans can now have spaces and punctuation in their names.

  * You can now enter your own farm name, which is used in the PDF output.
