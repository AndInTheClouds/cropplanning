Release Notes for Version 0.7.0

### WARNING

This software is still in a "beta" state.  This means that
the software may be finicky or unpredictable.  Please use this program,
but do expect some bumps along the way.  **Back up your data files frequently!**

### Enhancements

* Crop plans can now be exported to a Google Calendar. (*experimental, but fun*)
* Support for DD/MM/YYYY style dates. üá¨üáß üá¶üá∫
* searching and filtering can now be done by specific field
  * eg, filtering for `name:winter` will just show crops with "Winter" in their name (like "Winter Squash"), while `var:winter` will just show varieties with "winter" in their name (like "Wintebor")
  * this works in the CropDB tab for these fields: crop, variety, groups, keywords
  * and in the CropPlan tab for these fields: crop, variety, location, groups, keywords
* a fancy, new About dialog
* number of plants is now included in the stats summarized under the planting list
* multiple records can be duplicated together (instead of one at a time)
* added keyboard shortcuts to certain fields:
  * in Crop Plans:
    * `Control + Option + b`: jump to "Beds to Plant"
    * `Control + Option + r`: jump to "Rowft to Plant"
    * `Control + Option + p`: jump to "Plants Needed"
    * `Control + Option + s`: jump to "Plants to Start"
    * `Control + Option + f`: jump to "Flats to Start"
  * in CropDB
    * `Control + Option + m`: jump to "Maturity Days"
    * `Control + Option + k`: jump to "Keywords"
  * these are obviously for a Mac, on Windows you'll have to play around to find what works, but it's probably `Control + Alt + b`, etc


### Bugs Fixed

* "Total Yield" can be used for planting calculations (eg "I need 300 cabbages on July 15th, when should I plant them?")
* If the program finds multiple crops or varieties with the same name, it won't croak anymore.
* fixed an issue where the field planting lists weren't sorting correctly in some situations
* stats and charts should work better when plans span multiple years
* if a number is entered with a unit (eg `18"`), the program will ask you to correct it
* the fudge factor has been improved for very small plantings
* prettied things up a bit
* plus, a bunch of other more esoteric issues have been fixed
