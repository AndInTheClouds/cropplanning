== Requirements ==

=== Java ===

This software requires Java version 1.5 (aka Java 5) or greater.  Java is available as a free download (website listed below) and we use it because it allows us to write one program which can easily run on most computers.

===== Verify Java Version =====

    Before anything else, check out this website which will check to see if you have Java installed and which version is installed:

[http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&try=1 Detect Java Version]

    They "recommend" Java 1.6 (aka Java 6), but you'll be fine for this software as long as they show that you have Java version 1.5.0 or higher

    Special _Mac_ information: All users of Mac OS X 10.4 or greater should be all set.  The Mac OS version number is available under the Apple menu in the upper left corner of the screen, select "About this Mac".  Any version above 10.4.0 will have Java 1.5 already installed.  If you don't have Mac OS X 10.4, your only option is to upgrade your operating system to 10.4 or 10.5.  Sorry.


===== Upgrade and/or Install Java =====

    The latest version of the "Java Runtime Environment" can be downloaded from http://www.java.com/ .  Look for the button that says "Free Java Download".  They will have you download Java 1.6 (or Java 6); this is fine.

    Special _Windows_ info: The age of your computer will only be an issue on truly ancient machines.  This software was created and runs fine on a computer that is over 7 years old.

    _Other users_: This software will run on any computer for which a version of Java 1.5 is available.  Please download the zip archive and follow the directions below, except that you'll have to run the program from the command line with the command `java -jar CropPlanning.jar`


== Installation ==

*Step 1*: Verify and/or Download and Install Java, as detailed above

*Step 2*: [http://code.google.com/p/cropplanning/downloads/list Download]

*Step 3*: Open the Archive

    _Mac_: The Mac version is distributed as a compressed disk image (a .dmg file).  To open the file, just double click on the .dmg file.  This will open the archive and "mount" it on your desktop as though it were a CD, DVD or hard drive.  Double click on the mounted drive to view the files in the archive.

    _Windows_: The Windows version is distributed as a compressed file archive.  Inside the archive is a directory which contains the "important" files.  There are two options for opening this archive:
        # modern Windows computers can simply double click on the .zip file to open it up and view the contents.
        # older Windows computers might not be able to do the double click trick and will have to use a 3rd party archive utility to open the file.  We suggest [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip].  Open the archive (the .zip file) in 7-Zip and proceed to the next step.


*Step 4*: Make Directory (_Mac only_, Windows users proceed to next step.)

    Right now, Mac users will have to create a directory on your computer for the software.  Your desktop would be a suitable place to do this: "Right click" or "CTRL Click" on your desktop and select "New Folder".  A suitable name for the directory might be `CropPlanning`, `CPS` or `CropPlans`.


*Step 5*: Copy/Install Program

    With the archive opened and displayed in a window, simply:

       _Mac_: drag the program file (`CropPlanning`) from the archive to the directory you created in the last step.

       _Windows_: drag the folder `CropPlanning` from the archive to a suitable location, such as your desktop.


*Step 6*: Open the program

    Open up the folder on your hard drive/desktop (not the archive file that you downloaded) that contains the program file.  On _Windows_, the program file is `CropPlanning.exe` and on _Mac_ the program file is `CropPlanning`.  Just double click on the program icon!
