CropPlanning
=======

CropPlanning is free, open source software to help small farmers plan and manage their production.  For downloads and more info, visit [https://code.google.com/p/cropplanning/](https://code.google.com/p/cropplanning/).

To download the code yourself simply

    git clone https://github.com/claytonrcarter/cropplanning.git
    
or of course fork it into your own github account.

You will need:

*  Netbeans + Java 1.5
*  A bundle of libraries which will soon be posted for download.
  *  They can be downloaded individually from across the net (instructions at the Google Code page) but it will easier when you can just download them as one.
